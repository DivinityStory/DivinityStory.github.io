        <h3>About Divinity</h3>
        <p>
            Divinity is a fantasy story series about a magical world where angels and demons are locked in seemingly
            neverending conflict. It’s been floating around in my head since around 2012, if memory serves, and it’s
            become my pride and joy.
            <br>
            <br>
            It was—and still is—intended to be a video game series, but its story has always been the main focus. (Not
            to mention the fact it’s far too ambitious to be realistic.) I’ve tried to write it down numerous times in
            the past, but never shared it publicly. That’s what this website is for. I’ll be posting “chapters” of
            Divinity in chronological order as I finish them. I hope you'll enjoy reading them!
            <br>
            <br>
            I also post chapters on
            <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/13366659/chapters/30608427">Archive of Our Own</a>, if you'd
            prefer to read them there. There will likely be editing quirks, but chapters there will otherwise be
            identical. (For example, AO3 doesn't have "prologues" or "chapter 0s," so any given chapter's number will be
            one greater than it should be.)
            <br>
            <br>
            I post extra, in-depth character bios on my <a href="https://toyhou.se/DivinityStory">toyhou.se</a> as
            characters are introduced. You can read about any given character’s physical attributes, background, and
            anything else I couldn’t find a place for in the story itself. These bios are purely supplementary.
            <br>
            <br>
            I love feedback of all kinds, as long you’re not just blatantly insulting me. Send me a tweet
            <a href="https://twitter.com/DivinityStory">@DivinityStory</a> and tell me what you think! I also post
            updates there, if you're interested.
