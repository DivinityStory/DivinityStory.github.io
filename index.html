            <h3>About Divinity</h3>
            <p>
                Divinity is a fantasy story series about a magical world where angels and demons are locked in seemingly
                neverending conflict. It’s been floating around in my head since around 2012, if memory serves, and it’s
                become my pride and joy.
                <br>
                <br>
                It was—and still is—intended to be a video game series, but its story has always been the main focus.
                (Not
                to mention the fact it’s far too ambitious to be realistic.) I’ve tried to write it down numerous times
                in
                the past, but never shared it publicly. That’s what this website is for. I’ll be posting “chapters” of
                Divinity in chronological order as I finish them. I hope you'll enjoy reading them!
                <br>
                <br>
                I also post chapters on
                <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/13366659/chapters/30608427">Archive of Our Own</a> and
                <a href="https://toyhou.se/~literature/34515.divinity">toyhou.se</a>, if you'd prefer to read them
                there. There will likely be editing quirks, but chapters there will otherwise be identical. (For
                example, AO3 and toyhou.se don't have "prologues" or "chapter 0s," so any given chapter's number will be
                one greater than it should be.)
                <br>
                <br>
                I post extra, in-depth character bios on
                <a href="https://toyhou.se/DivinityStory/characters">toyhou.se</a> as characters are introduced. You can
                read about any given character’s physical attributes, background, and anything else I couldn’t find a
                place for in the story itself. These bios are purely supplementary.
                <br>
                <br>
                I love feedback of all kinds, as long you’re not just blatantly insulting me. Send me a tweet
                <a href="https://twitter.com/DivinityStory">@DivinityStory</a> and tell me what you think! I also post
                updates there, if you're interested.

            <h3>Content Warning</h3>
            <p>
                The violence in Divinity is not flagrantly grotesque, but it is present, and not suited for children.
                (Example: Lightly detailed gore, semi-frequent human / angel / demon death.) <strong>Reader discretion
                    is
                    advised.</strong>
            </p>

                <p>
                    This may be because you have some kind of tracking protection / blocker turned on.
                    <br><br>
                    I've set Twitter's "do not track" parameters and whatnot to true, but that doesn't necessarily mean
                    the timeline will be let through tracking protection; They sound similar, but "tracking protection"
                    and "Do Not Track" are different things. (Do Not Track is a "please don't enter" sign. Tracking
                    protection is a brick wall.)
